# TODO
________

- move .ico to root

- should client/assets/data/global.json not be copied to gh pages?

- fix naming convention for index index.less

- combine google font requests

- clean up styles folder

- less uses the last time a variable was defined
- - means we can probably clean up the pipeline for how variables are defined (do it all at the end instead of awkwardly in the middle of bootstrap)

- spacing of splash is off for mobile (content needs to be higher up)


# Backlog
___________

- posts
- pics
- add some margin top to the side in the sections
- img-circle css not working on first page load


# Notes
_________

## favicon.ico
- reference: https://github.com/audreyr/favicon-cheat-sheet
- for converting pngs to ico: http://convertico.org/Multi_Image_to_one_icon/
- chrome needed a 256x256 to work (dunno why)
