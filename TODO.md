# TODO
________

- add some margin top to the side in the sections

- slow scroll
- add slow scroll links
- effect for the Nav + button
- effect for the Nav items
- remove bold effect from nav items (or doing something different on hover)


- backwards opacity has to happen dynamically whether open or closed
-- e.g. do the border first on open and last on closed
- click the spinning plus as many times as you want

- fix timing
- clean up



- cursor pointer on all links

- hover link should have a default color of text color, not blue
- img-circle css not working on first page load
- i think more thought needs to be put into how the page and css is structured
- - to maximize reuse for new sites
- - e.g. things like navbar, sections, header, footer should be easily reusable
- edit the README !!!
- also edit the TODO file (split it into sections, make it nice looking, etc)
- add a nice markdown compiler that plays nicely with other json data
- fix the pipeline
- - perhaps use a grunt plugin to only run moved tasks
- condense the list of grunt plugins
- - probably don't need the karma plugins / don't even know what they do
