# TODO
________

- use vh for the margin top space above the splash
- fix bug with golden content (not right width)
- use rem
- - and the space below the splash
- - can you have negative vh?
- more thought into transitions
- - also make the code for this look nicer
- - http://blog.alexmaccaw.com/css-transitions
- img-circle css not working on first page load
- i think more thought needs to be put into how the page and css is structured
- - to maximize reuse for new sites
- - e.g. things like navbar, sections, header, footer should be easily reusable
- put data in data file
- rename joe.jpg to me.jpg
- remove header.jpg (or use it somewhere)
- edit the README !!!
- condense the list of grunt plugins
- - probably don't need a;; the karma plugins / don't even know what they do
- also edit the TODO file (split it into sections, make it nice looking, etc)
- put global data in global data file
- and use it
- add a nice markdown compiler that plays nicely with other json data
- fix JavaScript
- - remove Backbone
- - include styles.js with jQuery
- - try to modularize
- abstract out some reuseable components
- - navbar
- - perhaps other things
- fix the pipeline
- - perhaps use a grunt plugin to only run moved tasks
