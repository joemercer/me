BLOG POST ABOUT MY RESUMER THING

basically it's just a website for data entering that results in a json file

let's you specify a tree of sections and bullets 

let's you select a section and add a new child section/bullet

let's you define what data properties go in that section (and which are modifiable)

let's you see existing section, dig into them, see all children

let's you modify an existing section

let's you add a section or a bullet


section
-> let's you define new properties on the section
-> gives you a .children
-> let's you define the data requires by .children


- everything timestamps changes
- timestamps entryDate
- tags (which are aggregated across all previous bullets in section)

- rating (?) number that represents relative importance - NO
- id (?) identifiable unique string - YES, but only for sections (unique identifier)
- class (?) - like CSS - how is this diff from tags? - NO
