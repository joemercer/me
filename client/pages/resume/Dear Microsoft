Dear Microsoft



To whom it may concern,

intro intro intro

I've done three work terms as a software engineer working with large web and mobile applications. I have experience writing code, and working on a team. 

These experiences have been valuable, but I'm realizing that being a software engineer is not for me. I like building ideas. I like understanding users, testing hypothesis. I'm becoming more interested in product design - questions of what do we build instead of how do we build it?

At my previous internships I haven't had much exposure to product - most of my time was spent acquanting myself with development systems, and then building new products. With the input that I had into product decisions I think I made a relatively large and positive impact. Good feeling

I'm ready to dedicate more time to pursuing that feeling. I'm committed to understanding a product, it's users, it's features, it's purpose so that I can innovate and consolidate and manage it.

22 years ago my dad graduated Waterloo and moved to REdmond to work for microsoft. I'm 21 right now. I've lived and worked in Austin, SF, NY, and now maybe it's time to come home. 


THIS NEEDS TO BE CUT DOWN
